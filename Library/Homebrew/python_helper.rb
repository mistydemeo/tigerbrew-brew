# This is used in the Formula class when the user calls
# `python`, `python2` or `python3`.

# This method has a dual nature. For one, it takes a &block and sets up
# the ENV such that a Python, as defined in the requirements, is the default.
# If there are multiple `PythonInstalled` requirements, the block is evaluated
# once for each Python. This makes it possible to easily support 2.x and
# 3.x Python bindings without code duplication in formulae.
# If you need to special case stuff, set :allowed_major_versions.
# Second, inside the block, a formula author may call this method to access
# certain convienience methods for the currently selected Python, e.g.
# `python.site_packages`.
# This method should be executed in the context of the formula, so that
# prefix is defined. Note, that this method will set @current_python to be
# able to refer to the current python if a block is executed for 2.x and 3.x.
