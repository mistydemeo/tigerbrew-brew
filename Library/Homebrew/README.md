# Homebrew Public API
We're (finally) working on a documented public API for Homebrew. It's currently a work in progress; a bunch of public stuff is documented and a bunch of private stuff is undocumented. Sorry about that!

The main class you should look at is {Formula}. Assume everything else is private for now.
