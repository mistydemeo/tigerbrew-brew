         Your shell has been configured to use Tigerbrew's build environment:
         this should help you build stuff. Notably though, the system versions of
         gem and pip will ignore our configuration and insist on using the
         environment they were built under (mostly). Sadly, scons will also
         ignore our configuration.
         All toolchain use will be logged to: ~/Library/Homebrew/Logs/cc.log
         When done, type `exit'.
