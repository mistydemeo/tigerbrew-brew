# FAQ
### How do I update my local packages?
First update the formulae and Homebrew itself:

    brew update

You can now find out what is outdated with:

    brew outdated

Upgrade everything with:

    brew upgrade

Or upgrade a specific formula with:

    brew upgrade $FORMULA

<a name="cleanup"></a>

### How do I stop certain formulae from being updated?
To stop something from being updated/upgraded:

    brew pin $FORMULA

To allow that formulae to update again:

    brew unpin $FORMULA

### How do I uninstall old versions of a formula?
By default, Homebrew does not uninstall old versions of a formula, so
over time you will accumulate old versions. To remove them, simply use:

    brew cleanup $FORMULA

or clean up everything at once:

    brew cleanup

to see what would be cleaned up:

    brew cleanup -n

<a name="uninstall"></a>

### How do I uninstall Homebrew?
If you installed to `/usr/local` then you can use the script in [this
gist](https://gist.github.com/1173223) to uninstall — it will only
remove Homebrew and the stuff Homebrew installed leaving anything else
in `/usr/local` alone.

Provided you haven’t put anything else in Homebrew’s prefix
(`brew --prefix`), you can generally just `rm -rf` that directory. This
is because Homebrew won’t touch files outside its prefix.

### How do I uninstall a formula?
If you do not uninstall all of the versions that Homebrew has installed,
Homebrew will continue to attempt to install the newest version it knows
about when you do (`brew upgrade`). This can be surprising.

To remove a formula entirely, you may do
(`brew uninstall formula_name --force`).

Be careful as this is a destructive operation and unfortunately, in
Homebrew 0.9.5 it seems that Homebrew does not support the `--dry-run`
option.

### Where does stuff get downloaded?

    brew --cache

Which is usually: `/Library/Caches/Homebrew`

### My Mac `.app`s don’t find `/usr/local/bin` utilities!
GUI apps on OS X don’t have `/usr/local/bin` in their `PATH` by default.
If you’re on Mountain Lion, you can fix this by running
`launchctl setenv PATH "/usr/local/bin:$PATH"`. [More details
here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/135688/setting-environment-variables-in-os-x/5444960#5444960),
including how to set this across reboots. If you’re pre-Mountain Lion,
[here’s an official
alternative](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#qa/qa1067/_index.html).

### How do I contribute to Homebrew?
Read everything in https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md.

### Why do you compile everything?
Projects distribute source tarballs, generally, but if they provide a
good binary, we’ll use it. Though we don’t always, because Homebrew is
about **homebrewing**, it’s half the point that you can just
`brew edit $FORMULA` and change how the formula is compiled to your own
specification.

Homebrew does provide pre-compiled versions for some formulae. These
pre-compiled versions are referred to as **bottles** and are available
at:
[http://sf.net/projects/machomebrew/files](http://sf.net/projects/machomebrew/files).

If available, bottled binaries will be used by default except under the
following conditions:

* Options were passed to the install command i.e. `brew install $FORMULA`
will use a bottled version of $FORMULA, but
`brew install $FORMULA —enable-bar` will trigger a source build.
* The `--build-from-source` option is invoked.
* The environment variable `HOMEBREW_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE` is set.
* The machine is not running OS X 10.8+ as all bottled builds are
generated on Mountain Lion or later.
* Homebrew is installed to a prefix other than the standard
`/usr/local` (although some bottles support this)

In order to completely disable bottled builds, simply add a value for
the environment variable `HOMEBREW_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE` to
your profile.

We aim to bottle everything.

### How do I get a formula from someone else’s branch?

    brew install hub
    brew update
    cd $(brew --repository)
    hub pull someone_else

Or:

`brew install http://raw.github.com/user/repo/branch/formula.rb`

Or:

`brew pull http://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/pulls/1234`

### Why does Homebrew insist I install to `/usr/local` with such vehemence?
<a name="usrlocal"></a>

1.  **It’s easier**<br>`/usr/local/bin` is already in your
    `PATH`.
2.  **It’s easier**<br>Tons of build scripts break if their dependencies
    aren’t in either `/usr` or `/usr/local`. We
    fix this for Homebrew formulae (although we don’t always test for
    it), but you’ll find that many RubyGems and Python setup scripts
    break which is something outside our control.
3.  **It’s safe**<br>Apple has left this directory for us. Which means
    there is no `/usr/local` directory by default, so there
    is no need to worry about messing up existing tools.

**If you plan to install gems that depend on
brews then save yourself a bunch of hassle and install to
`/usr/local`!**

It is not always straightforward to tell `gem` to look in non-standard directories for headers and libraries. If you choose `/usr/local`, many things will "just work".

### Why does Homebrew say sudo is bad? <a name="sudo"></a>
**tl;dr** Sudo is dangerous, and you installed TextMate.app without sudo
anyway.

Homebrew is designed to work without using sudo. You can decide to use
it but we strongly recommend not to do so. If you have used sudo and run
into a bug then it is likely to be the cause. Please don’t file a bug
report unless you can reproduce it after reinstalling Homebrew from
scratch without using sudo.

You should only ever sudo a tool you trust. Of course, you can trust
Homebrew ;) But do you trust the multi-megabyte Makefile that Homebrew
runs? Developers often understand C++ far better than they understand
make syntax. It’s too high a risk to sudo such stuff. It could break
your base system, or alter it subtly.

And indeed, we’ve seen some build scripts try to modify
`/usr` even when the prefix was specified as something else
entirely.

Did you `chown root /Applications/TextMate.app`? Probably
not. So is it that important to `chown root wget`?

If you need to run Homebrew in a multi-user environment, consider
creating a separate user account especially for use of Homebrew.

### Why isn’t a particular command documented?

If it’s not in `man brew`, it’s probably an external command. These are documented [here](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/External-Commands.md).

### Why haven’t you pulled my pull request?
If it’s been a while, bump it with a “bump” comment. Sometimes we miss requests and there are plenty of them. Maybe we were thinking on something. It will encourage consideration. In the meantime if you could rebase the pull request so that it can be cherry-picked more easily we will love you for a long time.

### Can I edit formulae myself?
Yes! It’s easy! Just `brew edit $FORMULA`. You don’t have to submit modifications back to*Homebrew/homebrew*, just edit the formula as you personally need it and `brew install`. As a bonus `brew update` will merge your changes with upstream so you can still keep the formula up-to-date **with** your personal modifications!

### Can I make new formulae?
Yes! It’s easy! Just `brew create URL` Homebrew will then open the
formula in `$EDITOR` so you can edit it, but it probably already
installs, try it: `brew install $FORMULA`. If you come up any issues,
run the command with the `-d` switch like so: `brew install -d $FORMULA`
which drops you into a debugging shell.

If you want your new formula to be part of *Homebrew/homebrew* or want
to learn more about writing formula then please read the [Formula Cookbook](Formula-Cookbook.md).

### Can I install my own stuff to `/usr/local`?
Yes, brew is designed to not get in your way so you can use it how you
like.

Install your own stuff, but be aware that if you install common
libraries, like libexpat yourself, it may cause trouble when trying to
build certain Homebrew formula. As a result `brew doctor` will warn you
about this.

Thus it’s probably better to install your own stuff to the Cellar and
then `brew link` it. Like so:

```bash
$ cd foo-0.1
$ brew diy
./configure —prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/foo/0.1
$ ./configure —prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/foo/0.1
[snip]
$ make && make install
$ brew link foo
Linking /usr/local/Cellar/foo/0.1… 17 symlinks created
```

### Where was a formula deleted?
Use `brew log $FORMULA` to find out!

Sometimes formula are moved to specialized repositories. These are the
likely candidates:

* [https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes)
* [https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-versions](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-versions)
* [https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-games](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-games)

You can use `brew tap` to access these formulae:

```bash
brew tap homebrew/games
brew install …
```

Note that brew search still finds formula in taps.

### Homebrew is a poor name, it is generic, why was it chosen?
mxcl was too concerned with the beer theme and didn’t consider that the
project may actually prove popular. By the time he realized it was too
late. However, today, the first google hit for “homebrew” is not beer
related ;-)

### What does *keg-only* mean?
It means the formula is installed only into the Cellar, it is not linked
into `/usr/local`. This means most tools will not find it. We don’t do
this for stupid reasons. You can link the formula in still if you need
to with `brew link`.

### How can I specify different configure arguments for a formula?
`brew edit $FORMULA` and edit the formula. Currently there is no
other way to do this, but we’ll design something like that into brew2.
