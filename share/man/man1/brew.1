.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBbrew\fR \-\-version
.
.br
\fBbrew\fR command [\-\-verbose|\-v] [options] [formula] \.\.\.
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Tigerbrew is the easiest and most flexible way to install the UNIX tools Apple didn\'t include with OS X\.
.
.SH "ESSENTIAL COMMANDS"
For the full command list, see the COMMANDS section\.
.
.P
With \fB\-\-verbose\fR or \fB\-v\fR, many commands print extra debugging information\. Note that these flags should only appear after a command\.
.
.TP
\fBinstall\fR \fIformula\fR
Install \fIformula\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBremove\fR \fIformula\fR
Uninstall \fIformula\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBupdate\fR
Fetch the newest version of Tigerbrew from GitHub using \fBgit\fR(1)\.
.
.TP
\fBlist\fR
List all installed formulae\.
.
.TP
\fBsearch\fR \fItext\fR|/\fItext\fR/
Perform a substring search of formula names for \fItext\fR\. If \fItext\fR is surrounded with slashes, then it is interpreted as a regular expression\. The search for \fItext\fR is extended online to some popular taps\. If no search term is given, all locally available formulae are listed\.
.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBaudit\fR [\-\-strict] [\-\-online] [\fIformulae\fR]: Check \fIformulae\fR for Tigerbrew coding style violations\. This should be run before submitting a new formula\.
.
.IP
If no \fIformulae\fR are provided, all of them are checked\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-strict\fR is passed, additional checks are run\. This should be used when creating for new formulae\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-online\fR is passed, additional slower checks that require a network connection are run\. This should be used when creating for new formulae\.
.
.IP
\fBaudit\fR exits with a non\-zero status if any errors are found\. This is useful, for instance, for implementing pre\-commit hooks\.

.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBcleanup [\-\-force] [\-\-prune=<days>] [\-ns]\fR [\fIformulae\fR]: For all installed or specific formulae, remove any older versions from the cellar\. By default, does not remove out\-of\-date keg\-only brews, as other software may link directly to specific versions\. In addition old downloads from the Tigerbrew download\-cache are deleted\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-force\fR is passed, remove out\-of\-date keg\-only brews as well\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-prune=<days>\fR is specified, remove all cache files older than \fIdays\fR\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-n\fR is passed, show what would be removed, but do not actually remove anything\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-s\fR is passed, scrubs the cache, removing downloads for even the latest versions of formula\. Note downloads for any installed formula will still not be deleted\. If you want to delete those too: \fBrm \-rf $(brew \-\-cache)\fR

.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBcreate <URL> [\-\-autotools|\-\-cmake] [\-\-no\-fetch] [\-\-set\-name <name>] [\-\-set\-version <version>]\fR: Generate a formula for the downloadable file at \fIURL\fR and open it in the editor\. Tigerbrew will attempt to automatically derive the formula name and version, but if it fails, you\'ll have to make your own template\. The wget formula serves as a simple example\.

\fBtap <user/repo>\fR taps a formula repository from GitHub using HTTPS\. Since so many taps are hosted on GitHub, this command is a shortcut for \fBtap user/repo https://github\.com/#{user}/homebrew\-#{repo}\fR\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBtap <user/repo> <URL>\fR taps a formula repository from anywhere, using any transport protocol that \fBgit\fR handles\. The one\-argument form of \fBtap\fR simplifies but also limits\.

.SH "EXTERNAL COMMANDS"
Tigerbrews, like \fBgit\fR(1), supports external commands\. These are executable scripts that reside somewhere in the PATH, named \fBbrew\-<cmdname>\fR or \fBbrew\-<cmdname>\.rb\fR, which can be invoked like \fBbrew cmdname\fR\. This allows you to create your own commands without modifying Tigerbrews\'s internals\.
.
.P
Instructions for creating your own commands can be found in the docs: \fIhttps://github\.com/mistydemeo/tigerbrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/External\-Commands\.md\fR
.
.SH "SPECIFYING FORMULAE"
Many Tigerbrew commands accept one or more \fIformula\fR arguments\. These arguments can take several different forms:
.
.TP
The name of a formula
e\.g\. \fBgit\fR, \fBnode\fR, \fBwget\fR\.
.
.TP
The fully\-qualified name of a tapped formula
Sometimes a formula from a tapped repository may conflict with one in mistydemeo/tigerbrew\. You can still access these formulae by using a special syntax, e\.g\. \fBhomebrew/dupes/vim\fR or \fBhomebrew/versions/node4\fR\.
.
.TP
An arbitrary URL

When using the S3 download strategy, Tigerbrew will look in these variables for access credentials (see \fIhttps://docs\.aws\.amazon\.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli\-chap\-getting\-started\.html#cli\-environment\fR to retrieve these access credentials from AWS)\. If they are not set, the S3 download strategy will download with a public (unsigned) URL\.

HOMEBREW_CACHE
If set, instructs Tigerbrew to use the given directory as the download cache\.

HOMEBREW_DEBUG
If set, any commands that can emit debugging information will do so\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_DEBUG_INSTALL

HOMEBREW_EDITOR
If set, Tigerbrew will use this editor when editing a single formula, or several formulae in the same directory\.
.
.IP
\fINOTE\fR: \fBbrew edit\fR will open all of Tigerbrew as discontinuous files and directories\. TextMate can handle this correctly in project mode, but many editors will do strange things in this case\.

.
.IP
Apache formulae are currently unaffected by this variable and can redirect to plaintext\.

.TP
HOMEBREW_NO_GITHUB_API
If set, Tigerbrew will not use the GitHub API for e\.g searches or fetching relevant issues on a failed install\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_INSTALL_BADGE

.
.IP
Set this to force Tigerbrew to use a particular svn binary\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_TEMP
If set, instructs Tigerbrew to use \fBHOMEBREW_TEMP\fR as the temporary directory for building packages\. This may be needed if your system temp directory and Tigerbrew Prefix are on different volumes, as OS X has trouble moving symlinks across volumes when the target does not yet exist\.
.
.IP
This issue typically occurs when using FileVault or custom SSD configurations\.
.
.TP

.SH "USING TIGERBREW BEHIND A PROXY"
Tigerbrew uses several commands for downloading files (e\.g\. curl, git, svn)\. Many of these tools can download via a proxy\. It\'s common for these tools to read proxy parameters from environment variables\.
.
.P
For the majority of cases setting \fBhttp_proxy\fR is enough\. You can set this in your shell profile, or you can use it before a brew command:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

http_proxy=http://<host>:<port> brew install foo
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
If your proxy requires authentication:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

http_proxy=http://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port> brew install foo
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
