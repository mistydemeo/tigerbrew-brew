Homebrew is the easiest and most flexible way to install the UNIX tools Apple didn\'t include with OS X\.
.
.SH "ESSENTIAL COMMANDS"
For the full command list, see the COMMANDS section\.
.

.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.
.TP
\fBaudit\fR [\fIformulae\fR]
Check \fIformulae\fR for Homebrew coding style violations\. This should be run before submitting a new formula\.
.
.IP
If no \fIformulae\fR are provided, all of them are checked\.
.
.IP
\fBaudit\fR exits with a non\-zero status if any errors are found\. This is useful, for instance, for implementing pre\-commit hooks\.
.
.TP
\fBcat\fR \fIformula\fR
Display the source to \fIformula\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBcleanup [\-\-force] [\-ns]\fR [\fIformulae\fR]
For all installed or specific formulae, remove any older versions from the cellar\. By default, does not remove out\-of\-date keg\-only brews, as other software may link directly to specific versions\. In addition old downloads from the Homebrew download\-cache are deleted\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-force\fR is passed, remove out\-of\-date keg\-only brews as well\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-n\fR is passed, show what would be removed, but do not actually remove anything\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-s\fR is passed, scrubs the cache, removing downloads for even the latest versions of formula\. Note downloads for any installed formula will still not be deleted\. If you want to delete those too: \fBrm \-rf $(brew \-\-cache)\fR
.

Generate a formula for the downloadable file at \fIURL\fR and open it in \fBEDITOR\fR\. Homebrew will attempt to automatically derive the formula name and version, but if it fails, you\'ll have to make your own template\. The wget formula serves as a simple example\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-autotools\fR is passed, create a basic template for an Autotools\-style build\. If \fB\-\-cmake\fR is passed, create a basic template for a CMake\-style build\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-no\-fetch\fR is passed, Homebrew will not download \fIURL\fR to the cache and will thus not add the SHA\-1 to the formula for you\.
.
.IP
The options \fB\-\-set\-name\fR and \fB\-\-set\-version\fR each take an argument and allow you to explicitly set the name and version of the package you are creating\.

.SH "EXTERNAL COMMANDS"
Homebrew, like \fBgit\fR(1), supports external commands\. These are executable scripts that reside somewhere in the PATH, named \fBbrew\-<cmdname>\fR or \fBbrew\-<cmdname>\.rb\fR, which can be invoked like \fBbrew cmdname\fR\. This allows you to create your own commands without modifying Homebrew\'s internals\.
.
.P
A number of (useful, but unsupported) external commands are included and enabled by default:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

$ ls `brew \-\-repository`/Library/Contributions/cmd
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0

.
.TP
The name of a formula
e\.g\. \fBgit\fR, \fBnode\fR, \fBwget\fR\.
.
.TP
The fully\-qualified name of a tapped formula
Sometimes a formula from a tapped repository may conflict with one in mxcl/master\. You can still access these formulae by using a special syntax, e\.g\. \fBhomebrew/dupes/vim\fR or \fBhomebrew/versions/node4\fR\.
.
.TP
An arbitrary URL
Homebrew can install formulae via URL, e\.g\. \fBhttps://raw\.github\.com/mxcl/homebrew/master/Library/Formula/git\.rb\fR\. The formula file will be cached for later use\.

.
.TP
HOMEBREW_CURL_VERBOSE
If set, Homebrew will pass \fB\-\-verbose\fR when invoking \fBcurl\fR(1)\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_DEBUG
If set, Homebrew always assumes \fB\-\-debug\fR when running commands\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_DEBUG_INSTALL
When \fBbrew install \-d\fR or \fBbrew install \-i\fR drops into a shell, \fBHOMEBREW_DEBUG_INSTALL\fR will be set to the name of the formula being brewed\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_DEBUG_PREFIX
When \fBbrew install \-d\fR or \fBbrew install \-i\fR drops into a shell, \fBHOMEBREW_DEBUG_PREFIX\fR will be set to the target prefix in the Cellar of the formula being brewed\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_DEVELOPER
If set, Homebrew will print warnings that are only relevant to Homebrew developers (active or budding)\.

Set this to force Homebrew to use a particular svn binary\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_TEMP
If set, instructs Homebrew to use \fBHOMEBREW_TEMP\fR as the temporary directory for building packages\. This may be needed if your system temp directory and Homebrew Prefix are on different volumes, as OS X has trouble moving symlinks across volumes when the target does not yet exist\.
.
.IP
This issue typically occurs when using FileVault or custom SSD configurations\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_USE_CLANG
If set, forces Homebrew to compile using clang\.

.SH "USING HOMEBREW BEHIND A PROXY"
Homebrew uses several commands for downloading files (e\.g\. curl, git, svn)\. Many of these tools can download via a proxy\. It\'s common for these tools to read proxy parameters from environment variables\.
.
.P
For the majority of cases setting \fBhttp_proxy\fR is enough\. You can set this in your shell profile, or you can use it before a brew command:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

http_proxy=http://<host>:<port> brew install foo
