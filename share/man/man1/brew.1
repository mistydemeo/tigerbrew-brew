.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBbrew\fR \-\-version
.
.br
\fBbrew\fR command [\-\-verbose|\-v] [options] [formula] \.\.\.
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Homebrew is the easiest and most flexible way to install the UNIX tools Apple didn\'t include with OS X\.
.
.SH "ESSENTIAL COMMANDS"
For the full command list, see the COMMANDS section\.
.
.P
With \fB\-\-verbose\fR or \fB\-v\fR, many commands print extra debugging information\. Note that these flags should only appear after a command\.
.
.TP
\fBinstall\fR \fIformula\fR
Install \fIformula\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBremove\fR \fIformula\fR
Uninstall \fIformula\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBupdate\fR
Fetch the newest version of Homebrew from GitHub using \fBgit\fR(1)\.
.
.TP
\fBlist\fR
List all installed formulae\.
.
.TP
\fBsearch\fR \fItext\fR|/\fItext\fR/
Perform a substring search of formula names for \fItext\fR\. If \fItext\fR is surrounded with slashes, then it is interpreted as a regular expression\. The search for \fItext\fR is extended online to some popular taps\. If no search term is given, all locally available formulae are listed\.
.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.
.TP
\fBaudit\fR [\fIformulae\fR]
Check \fIformulae\fR for Homebrew coding style violations\. This should be run before submitting a new formula\.
.
.IP
If no \fIformulae\fR are provided, all of them are checked\.
.
.IP
\fBaudit\fR exits with a non\-zero status if any errors are found\. This is useful, for instance, for implementing pre\-commit hooks\.
.
.TP
\fBcat\fR \fIformula\fR
Display the source to \fIformula\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBcleanup [\-\-force] [\-ns]\fR [\fIformulae\fR]
For all installed or specific formulae, remove any older versions from the cellar\. By default, does not remove out\-of\-date keg\-only brews, as other software may link directly to specific versions\. In addition old downloads from the Homebrew download\-cache are deleted\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-force\fR is passed, remove out\-of\-date keg\-only brews as well\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-n\fR is passed, show what would be removed, but do not actually remove anything\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-s\fR is passed, scrubs the cache, removing downloads for even the latest versions of formula\. Note downloads for any installed formula will still not be deleted\. If you want to delete those too: \fBrm \-rf $(brew \-\-cache)\fR
.
.TP

Show a list of built\-in and external commands\.
.
.TP
\fBcreate <URL> [\-\-autotools|\-\-cmake] [\-\-no\-fetch] [\-\-set\-name <name>] [\-\-set\-version <version>]\fR
Generate a formula for the downloadable file at \fIURL\fR and open it in the editor\. Homebrew will attempt to automatically derive the formula name and version, but if it fails, you\'ll have to make your own template\. The wget formula serves as a simple example\. For a complete cheat\-sheet, have a look at
.
.IP
\fB$(brew \-\-prefix)/Library/Contributions/example\-formula\.rb\fR

.
.IP
Set this to force Homebrew to use a particular svn binary\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_TEMP
If set, instructs Homebrew to use \fBHOMEBREW_TEMP\fR as the temporary directory for building packages\. This may be needed if your system temp directory and Homebrew Prefix are on different volumes, as OS X has trouble moving symlinks across volumes when the target does not yet exist\.
.
.IP
This issue typically occurs when using FileVault or custom SSD configurations\.
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_VERBOSE
If set, Homebrew always assumes \fB\-\-verbose\fR when running commands\.
.
.TP
VISUAL
If set, and \fBHOMEBREW_EDITOR\fR is not, use \fBVISUAL\fR as the text editor\.
.
.SH "USING HOMEBREW BEHIND A PROXY"
Homebrew uses several commands for downloading files (e\.g\. curl, git, svn)\. Many of these tools can download via a proxy\. It\'s common for these tools to read proxy parameters from environment variables\.
.
.P
For the majority of cases setting \fBhttp_proxy\fR is enough\. You can set this in your shell profile, or you can use it before a brew command:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf
